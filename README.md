# x_and_o
This folder contains three files. 
nwn_x_o.py is the code used to build an artificial neural network with keras and train it to play x's and o's (tic-tac-toe) with reinforcement learning.
The algorithm to do so was derived from the following article: https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/

The play_the_nwn.py allows one to play the trained neural network at tic-tac-toe. The neural network is stored in the file single_31600Its_500000Mem.h5

Disclaimer: I wrote and ran this code on an old laptop, it wont run properly on my current machine due to tensorflow issues. Hopefully it will work for you if you try to run it.
